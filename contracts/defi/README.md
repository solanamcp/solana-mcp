## Overview
The `defi` folder contains smart contracts for decentralized finance operations, such as staking and liquidity pools.

## Folder Structure
```
defi/
├── staking.sol         # Contract for staking operations
├── liquidityPool.sol   # Contract for liquidity pool management
└── ...                 # Additional DeFi contracts
```

## Development
1. Implement DeFi contracts in Solidity.
2. Ensure contracts are secure and optimized for performance.
3. Test contracts with various scenarios to ensure reliability.
